### Get data

This allows you to filter data from the EMS database by site (Station or EMS_ID), Variable and Date. Multiple sites can be selected. One variable can be selected.

**Sites**  

All possible sites are shown initially in the dropdown menu. These options can be reduced by selecting a watershed or permit number. Sites and watersheds can also be selected using the 'Site Map' tab.  

**Variables**  

Once site selection is made, variables with data for those sites are then shown in the 'Select variable' dropdown. You can select whether you only want to show variables that are available for ALL selected sites, or just for ANY of the sites. 

**Dates**  

The minimum and maximum date range are automatically determined from the data. This can then be refined.
