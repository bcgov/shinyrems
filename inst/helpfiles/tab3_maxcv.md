### Maximum Coefficient of Variation (CV) 

A number indicating the maximum permitted CV for replicates when calculating summary value. Leave input blank for default value of infinity.

**For example:**  

If there are three or more replicates with a coefficient of variation (CV) in exceedance of the 'Maximum Coefficient of Variation' value, then the replicates with the highest absolute deviation is dropped until the CV is less than or equal to 'Maximum Coefficient of Variation' or only two values remain. By default all values are averaged.

A 'Maximum Coefficient of Variation' value of 1.29 is exceeded by two zero and one positive value (CV = 1.73) or by two identical positive values and a third value an order or magnitude greater (CV = 1.30). It is not exceed by one zero and two identical positive values (CV = 0.87).

**CV definition:**  

Coeffecient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and shows the extent of variability in relation to the mean of the data. Even if two sets of data have drastically different means, the degree of variation can still be compared.
