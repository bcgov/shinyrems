### Water Quality Guideline app

The [Water Quality Guideline app](https://bcgov-env.shinyapps.io/bc_wqg/), developed by the BC Government, allows the user to select a variable, value and media to view/download a table of the guideline and corresponding notes. If the value of another variable is required for calculation of the guideline (e.g. pH) the user will have that option.
