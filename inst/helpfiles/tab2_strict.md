### Strict matching

In the tidying process, ShinyRems attempts to match parameter names in the Variable column of the dataset to officially recognised parameter names. With strict matching on, all words are required to match a recognised parameter name. With strict matching off, only the first word is required to match. See 'Messages' tab for details on what actions were performed.
