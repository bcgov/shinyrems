Shinyrems is a web application to analyze water quality data. There are three options for viewing data:  

* download from the Environmental Monitoring System (EMS) database. Shinyrems pulls data from the B.C. Data Catalogue EMS Results, which is licenced under the Open Government Licence - British Columbia. This app does not interact with the EMS database;

* upload by a user in .csv format;

* download federal/provincial water quality monitoring site data from the Environment Canada Freshwater quality monitoring online data portal. 

Shinyrems allows the user to view site location, filter, clean and plot data. The app uses the R packages rems and wqbc. Shinyrems is meant to provide the user an efficient way to view water quality data and compare to various benchmarks. It is up to the user to ensure correctness of the raw data, outlier detection, water quality guideline calculation and summary statistics.
